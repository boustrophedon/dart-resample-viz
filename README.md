# Dart LLL resample algorithm vizualizer

This was a Dart implementation of the Moser-Tardos resample algorithm, which is an [algorithmic version of the Lov√°sz local lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_Lov%C3%A1sz_local_lemma). 

It was written for visualization purposes for the paper [The Moser-Tardos Resample algorithm: Where is the limit?](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611974768.13) published in ALENEX 2017.
