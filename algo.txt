vertex:
	x position
	y position
	edge list
	color
edge:
	vertex 1, vertex 2
	priority
	isbad


generate n by n grid
	1000 by 1000 2d array
	generate a vertex for each position in the array
	create edge objects for each edge by going through the array and creating edges Edge(v, vertices[y][x+1 mod 1000], i) Edge(v, vertices[y+1 mod 1000][x], i++) where the last thing is priority
	add to vertex's edge list
for each vertex, color it randomly with one of 6 color, with set probabilities

check for bad edges and insert into heap
	traverse edge list, check if bad, add to heap

resample:
	get top edge from heap
	resample both vertices
	check all edges from both vertices for badness, add to heap

resample until heap is empty
